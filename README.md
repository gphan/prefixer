Infix to Prefix Equation Solver
===============================

A Java project that takes an equation as input in the form:

<pre>
	( a + b ) * 2 + 3 * ( x )
</pre>

It doesn't lex the lack of spaces correctly so you have to add spaces between tokens.

This is a project I did for a job interview / screening. I didn't get an in-person interview.
You can see why here. It does the job, but very poorly.
